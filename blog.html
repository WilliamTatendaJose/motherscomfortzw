                    <p>
                       <thead>I was a mother of one and my husband was not working. Life was hard for us to an extent that putting food on the table was a challenge. This was the time I got pregnant for my second born child. I got to find out I was pregnant when I fell ill and went to the hospital only to realise, I was 7 months pregnant. I got so worried because I knew I had missed a lot of antenatal care and I had to register my pregnancy at the earliest so I can at least get some care in the remaining 2 months of my pregnancy, besides worrying about the delay in getting antenatal care, I also got worried because I didn’t have money to register at a local clinic for antenatal care. I really hoped I could find the registration fees that month but that was just a dream my due date arrived before I could even register. My labour came and unregistered as I was, I went to the nearest health facility, they attended to me, and I had a safe delivery however they could not discharge me before I could settle my hospital bills. I spent additional 2 days after my discharge date at the health facility as we did not have money to settle our bill. It was an emotional time for me as instead of enjoying being a mom, I was busy worrying about my bill and wondering when we would find the money so I can be discharged.</thead>

                    <p><h2><i>Lucy</i></h2>
                       <thead>I am a member of an apostolic sect and we do not subscribe to use of contraceptives and giving birth at a health facility, I got pregnant with my 5th child however this pregnant was different from the other four. I had placenta previa and the older women who helped women give birth at the church did not know how to deal with the situation, I realised I had to make a choice and I decided to go to a health facility against my religious belief and they advised me on self-care ways like not doing strenuous activities, avoiding sexual intercourse, avoiding standing for long periods of hours to help with my condition and I also had to have blood transfusion. I had a c-section at 36 weeks and gave birth to my beautiful baby girl who is named Makanaka.</thead>

                    <p><h2><i>Mai Ethan</i></h2>
                     <thead>I was a teen mother and hid my pregnancy for 5 months from my parents, when they got to know I was pregnant they supported me and had my pregnancy registered at a local clinic, I would attend my antenatal classes regularly, I realised I was anaemic during my second trimester something that I didn’t know. I got folic acids to help with the anaemia. During our antenatal classes I was taught on how I should take care of my health and my pregnancy, I was also told what labour would be like and what I would be expected to do during labour. Not only that I was also taught how I should take care of my baby after I give birth. This knowledge on top of the support from my family made me accept my pregnancy which was unwanted for 5 months and I love my son.</thead>

                    <p><h2><i>Anonymous</i></h2>
                        <thead>I got pregnant for the second born just about the same time my husband lost his job, we were struggling to make ends meet and life was so hard for us, we both resorted to vending, my husband was selling bread and I was selling vegetables. We managed to raise funds for registration fees for antenatal care when my pregnancy was at 4 months, and we planned to buy the baby essentials monthly for the remaining 5 months of our pregnancy. This seemed like a very easy plan to implement but for people surviving on hand to mouth it was a struggle, we could not get anything on the 6th month, the 7th month we bought a dish for bathing the baby and a bucket, 8th month we decided to buy a tracksuit, hat and socks and the 9th month came, we raised money for transport to the clinic and that was it, our baby came and we only had one set of clothing, ladies from our church ended up raising money to buy baby essentials and giving me pre loved clothes so my child could have something to put on.</thead>
